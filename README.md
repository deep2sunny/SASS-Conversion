# sass-conversion
Sample Site to be used as practice in converting CSS to SASS
In your SASS files you need to meet the following requirements:

1. Three partials _variables.scss, _mixins.scss, _queries.scss which get imported into your main.scss file.

2. Only one CSS file created - main.css

3. Use SASS variables for colours and fonts.

4. Use SASS parent selector - &

5. Use SASS @extend

6. Use @content with your media queries.

7. Use Nesting in your SASS.

8. Use @include with your @mixin s.

9. Use a @mixin to calculate the sizes of your columns.

Things to Watch
Make sure that you replicate all the changes in font-size, color, background-color, font-weight, column widths, icon sizes, padding, floats, and alignment.

Use the original CSS file from the "raw-css" folder in the repo as your reference to get the specifics for all the changes that you see. Make sure you don't overwrite the raw-css/main.css file. Use SASS to overwrite the css/main.css file.

Bonus Marks
You can earn 4 Bonus marks by trying to be efficient with how your CSS is being written and generated. If you can write your SASS in such a way that the finished version of your main.css file is less than 6500 bytes, WITHOUT altering the appearance and design of the site, including any colour changes that happen in the media queries, then you get the 4 bonus marks. Less than 6600 bytes will earn 2 Bonus marks.
